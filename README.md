<img src="static/logo.png" alt="Pee-Yew Logo" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; max-width: 100px;">

**Pee-Yew Photo Uploader** is a web application designed to upload images to a select directory. It features a user-friendly interface for uploading images, sorting them by name or date, and displaying them in a gallery format. Users can also delete images directly from the interface.

This is a good option for uploading files to a photo-slideshow.

   ```
3.	**Settings**:
    Here are some settings in the Python script which you might wish to change.
    Descriptions which start with an asterisk `*` denote a setting which is also available in the WebGUI. 
    | Variable | Description |
    | -------- | -------- |
    | `port=` | The port on which this site will run on |
    | `UPLOAD_FOLDER` | * Where to upload images |
    | `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` | * Which extensions to allow |
    | `MAX_HEIGHT` | * Max height of uploaded images. Taller images will be shrunk to fit. |
    | `MAX_WIDTH` | * Max width of uploaded images. Wider images will be shrunk to fit. |
    | `batch_size` | * Number of files to process per batch (default: 50). Uploads larger than this will be automatically batched. |
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python3 photo_uploader.py
   ```
   The application will be accessible at `http://<your-ip>:5001`.

## Docker Deployment

### Quick Start with Docker
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name photo-uploader \
  -p 5001:5001 \
  -v ./config:/app/config \
  -v ./uploads:/app/uploads \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  joewalters/photo-uploader:latest
```

### Docker Compose
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoeWalters/photo-uploader.git
cd photo-uploader
docker-compose up -d
```

### Unraid
Search for "Photo Uploader" in Community Applications or see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for complete Docker deployment guide.**

### Command Line Options
You can customize settings via command line arguments:
```bash
python3 photo_uploader.py --upload-folder ~/my_photos --port 8080 --host 127.0.0.1
```

Available options:
- `--upload-folder`: Set upload directory path
- `--port`: Set server port (default: 5001)
- `--host`: Set server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode
- `--max-file-size`: Set maximum file size in MB

### Configuration File
Settings are stored in `config/config.json` and persist between runs. You can edit this file directly to customize your setup.

#### Configuration Structure:
```json
{
    "server": {
        "host": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": 5001,
        "debug": false
    },
    "upload": {
        "folder": "~/photo_uploads",
        "max_file_size_mb": 10,
        "allowed_extensions": ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "webp"],
        "batch_size": 50
    },
    "image_processing": {
        "max_width": 1920,
        "max_height": 1080,
        "auto_rotate": true,
        "optimize": true,
        "quality": 85
    }
}
```

See `config/README.md` for detailed configuration options.

## Batch Upload Feature

When uploading more than 50 photos (configurable), the application automatically switches to batch processing mode to ensure reliable uploads:

### How It Works
- **Automatic Detection**: When you select more than 50 files, the UI will indicate batch processing will be used
- **Client-Side Batching**: Large uploads are split into smaller HTTP requests (25 files max per request) to prevent "413 Request Entity Too Large" errors
- **Real-Time Progress**: Progress bar and counters update as each batch completes
- **Error Resilience**: If one batch fails, the remaining batches continue processing
- **No Server Timeouts**: Small batch sizes prevent HTTP request timeouts

### Configuration
- **Batch Size**: Adjustable in Settings (default: 50 files per batch)
- **Threshold**: Any upload larger than the batch size triggers automatic batching
- **Progress Display**: Uploads over 100 files automatically show the progress page

### Benefits
- **Eliminates 413 Errors**: No more "Request Entity Too Large" errors when uploading hundreds of files
- **Prevents Timeouts**: Small batch sizes prevent HTTP request timeouts
- **Better Error Handling**: Individual batch failures don't stop the entire upload
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Live progress updates show exactly what's happening
- **Scalable**: Can handle thousands of photos without server resource issues
